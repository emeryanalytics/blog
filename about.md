<br/>
My name is Liam Bui. I graduated with double degree in Computer Science & Business Analytics, and a masters in Big Data & Machine Learning. I am also a Certified Analytics Professional (CAP) - awarded by the Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences (INFORMS).
<br/>

I am fortunate to witness the power of data science in my work across R&D and business analytics. My current interest involves applications of computer vision and machine learning/deep learning in physical and biological science.
